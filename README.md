### Info ###

To create new avatars, the Multiavatar mixes different parts of different avatars, and different color themes.

The total number of unique avatars: 48^6 = 12,230,590,464

One of the main Multiavatar functions is to work as an identicon. Every unique avatar can be identified by the unique string of characters, associated with the avatar.

The string of characters is also the input for the Multiavatar package, which converts the provided string into a 6 double-digit numbers (range 00-47), each representing an individual part of the final avatar.

`000000000000` - this string of numbers represents the very first avatar + its A theme. You can also read it like this: `00 00 00 00 00 00`.

`474747474747` - this is the 12,230,590,464th avatar (or the 16th initial avatar + its "C" color theme).

More info can be found in the `random_avatar.dart` file comments.
